# Platform IaC + Copilot Scaffold

This repository contains platform Infrastructure-as-Code and a recommended `.github` scaffold for VS Code Copilot Custom Agents, Skills, Prompts, and Instructions tailored for platform engineers.

## What I added
- `.github/` folder with example `agents/`, `instructions/`, `skills/`, and `prompts/` to integrate Copilot into platform workflows.

## Next steps
- Review the files under `.github/` and adjust instructions and skills to match your org policies.
- Commit the `.github/` folder to a repository used by your team so VS Code Copilot can discover it.
