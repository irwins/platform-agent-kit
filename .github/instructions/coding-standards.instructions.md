# Coding Standards

These rules are repository-authoritative and should be enforced by agents and CI checks.

- Use conventional commits. Keep commit messages concise and descriptive.
- Prefer smaller, reviewable changes over large monolith PRs.
- Follow repository formatting rules (PowerShell uses `PSScriptAnalyzer`, Bicep uses `bicep fmt`).
- Include unit/validation tests for code that can be tested.
